Follow the existing project code style, naming conventions, formatting, and architectural patterns. Do not introduce new styles or patterns unless explicitly requested. Do not add comments to every function by default. Comments are only allowed when strictly necessary, such as a short function description explaining its purpose. Avoid inline, redundant, or obvious comments.
